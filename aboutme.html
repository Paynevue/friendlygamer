    <p>A little about your friendly gamer. My name is Payne Vue and I am currently taking classes to become a web developer. I am currently learning html at Correlation1 and It's been going pretty great so far! It's been a while since I have been back in school so It's been nice using my brain again and not just working my self to death. So far I think what I find the most interesting is making image maps and forms. I've always wondered how all this works and now I'm on the inside and doing it! So, i would like to thank everyone at Correlation1! Thanks guys, for everything you guys do and expect big things from me!
